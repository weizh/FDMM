    Hong Kong legal expert Wang Jin, who is familiar with mainland Chinese laws, believed that the authorities sentenced
    excessively heavily on Lu Jianhua ; one reason was that Lu Jianhua is a citizen of mainland China, and the other reason
    is that the authorities wanted to severely discipline people within the system with this opportunity.
