    For example, if the court says it is clearly the fact that the legislature of the state of Florida can determine for
    itself who its electors will be, that will pretty much end the case, because that's what the legislature already plans
    to do, and that does n't mean the Gore people wo n't keep trying, because ultimately Congress has to decide and only
    Congress can decide if there are competing slates of electors submitted, which slate to accept.
