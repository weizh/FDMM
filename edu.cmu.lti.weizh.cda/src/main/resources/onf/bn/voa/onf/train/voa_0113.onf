    What we have proposed and the government of Indonesia is willing to embark on discussions with the UN officials in
    Jakarta is for UN security experts to be sent to the camps and to assess the situation, and of course, East Timor
    perhaps as a whole, to assess the situation, together with the Indonesian military and police, and it would be on the
    basis of their assessment that a decision would then be taken as to whether the humanitarian agents should go back to
    West Timor or not.
