    Some Israelis at least, if not most of them, are still hoping that President Clinton might be able to intervene and help
    in the short time he has left, but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in the States, I think more
    and more Israelis are worried that there's nobody to turn to, and I think what happened in the past few days among
    Israelis here is a new perception that maybe things in the United States are not as perfect as they might have thought.
