    In fact, just weeks after he was elected he showed Washington that he has his own initiatives and some of them might
    even frighten leaders in our national capital there, so I think you can expect Fox to continue the economic policies
    that Mexico has been criticized for, that is following the economic lead of the United States, but at the same time he
    will come up with concrete policies for dealing with immigrants ' rights and other such matters that we have never
    really seen before.
