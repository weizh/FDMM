    The Kursk Foundation says that the nuclear reactors, there are two on board, are safe for the time being but that the
    corrosive effects of seawater could in time lead to radioactive leaks into the ocean, which obviously could have
    devastating consequences on the fishery and the environment in general.

    The second is a huge platform with very large cranes on it, perhaps a platform of the type more usually used for oil and
    gas exploration, and a third vessel involved is what the rescuers describe as a giant offshore barge and the plan is to
    lift the submarine off the seabed, attach it to the underneath of this barge and then take it to the Russian naval port
    of Mamansk.
