    However, our electoral system is so much more simple in the sense that we have separate elections for the Presidency,
    for Parliament, for our mayors and therefore usually most French voters are faced with the difficulty of choosing a
    little paper ballotenne with a name on it and putting that in an envelop and then put that in the urn, so there is a
    much less chance of error, at least, in our French system.

    Alexis de Tocqueville who visited America and wrote an amazingly good book about American democracy, said exactly that,
    that America seemed to him to be the single country in the world who has managed to apply the separation of powers
    between the judiciary, the executive, and the legislative in a better way than any other country.
