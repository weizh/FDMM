    As we heard from David Gregory, one of Governor Bush's main themes in these last days of the campaign is getting rid of
    partisan gridlock in Washington, which was exactly what the President was talking about today--an attempt to reopen
    debate on a $ 240 billion tax cut plan, saying the version House Republicans passed is unacceptable, because it is
    unfair, according to the President, to children and seniors.
