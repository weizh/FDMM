    That's an interesting question because Vladimir Putin on Wednesday addressed the Indian Parliament just as Bill Clinton
    had done six months ago, and I think it's safe to say that Mr. Putin actually probably accomplished more than Mr.
    Clinton did in the hard concrete terms of arms sales and that sort of thing, but it was Mr. Clinton that stole the
    Indian lawmakers ' hearts.
