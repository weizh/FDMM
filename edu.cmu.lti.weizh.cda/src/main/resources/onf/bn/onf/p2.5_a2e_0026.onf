Plain sentence:

    The winning president in these elections faces a difficult challenge to his ability to govern Ecuador for the next four
    years, as it is a politically unstable country that has overthrown many presidents : the last of them was Lucio
    Gutierrez, who dissolved the Supreme Court and appointed new judges who cancelled an arrest warrant against a former
    president accused of corruption.
