--------------------
    Mr. Milosevic said I believe 0 this decision must be respected *-1 and for the first time describes the opposition
    leader as President - elect , but he said 0 he would not ignore the support of those who *T*-2 did vote for him in
    election of September 24th and would therefore lead his forces *PRO*-3 to become a strong opposition party , which he
    said 0 *T*-4 would win convincingly in the next round of elections .
