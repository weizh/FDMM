    Let's go to Russia right now Joe, where Vladimir Putin who still remains something of an enigmatic presence in the
    Russian political scene since he took office at the beginning of the year 2000, is apparently under siege yet again by
    revelations that the Russians might possibly have been able to rescue those trapped sailors in the Kursk submarine
    because some of them evidently survived and it's apparent that the Russian military suppressed information about what
    had happened or even distorted it, and was singularly slow in taking up offers of assistance from the Norwegians and the
    British to help.
