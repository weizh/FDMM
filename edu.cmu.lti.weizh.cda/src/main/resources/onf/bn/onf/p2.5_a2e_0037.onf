    Whereas only Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas received an invitation to visit the Jordanian capital next Sunday, the
    Hamas movement announced its welcome to the Jordanian role, but it confirmed its position in which it considers the only
    way out of the crisis is a national unity government on the basis of the national reconciliation accord, and not
    according to American and Israeli measures, according to Hamas.
