    As Bob pointed out, the next battleground is a bill to block lawsuits by victims of gun violence or families against
    gunmakers and dealers, and one person whose suit would be blocked is Denise Johnson if the legislation goes through, the
    widow of bus driver Conrad Johnson, the last person killed in the Washington, D.C. sniper attacks.
