Plain sentence:

    Well, there are really no precedents here Tony because, as you mentioned, the last trial of an alleged foreign spy, was
    actually the trial of Gary Powers way back in 1961, and Gary Powers was shot down over Russia, so his guilt was fairly
    firmly established and ever since then any suspected spies were usually either sort of simply kicked out of the country,
    expelled, or they were arrested and then swapped for Russian spies arrested in Western countries.
