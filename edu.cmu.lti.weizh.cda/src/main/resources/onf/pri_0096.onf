    So basically neither side enters this with a great sense of hope, but I think both sides ultimately recognize that in a
    way if they are to have some kind of agreement or if they are to live with each other, they have either got to do it by
    negotiation or by blood and I think obviously most people would rather live with each other in peace, the peace which
    can be found through negotiations.
